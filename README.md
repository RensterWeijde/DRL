# DRL
Deep Reinforcement Learning exercises

Hey guys,

Here is my submission for the navigation project using DQN. I've made it simple and included the agent classes etc. in the same file, so just this file is needed to understand the whole code.

NOTE: you need the version of 170319 versions, not the older ones,

Cheers,

Rens
