# DRL
Deep Reinforcement Learning exercises

Hey guys,

Here is my submission for the navigation project using DQN. I've made it simple and included the agent classes etc. in the same file, so just this file is needed to understand the whole code.

The only thing I'm missing is the weights file; can't locate it on the workspace. But I assume this will work out with the code provided (torch.save function is in there).

NOTE: you need the version of 170319 versions, not the older ones,

Cheers,

Rens
